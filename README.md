# MOO-Studio
The main goal of this project is to design a software system which empowers users with the ability to interactively solve Multi-Objective Optimisation Problems through an intuitive graphical user interface; the system will solve such problems with the aid of efficient algorithms. Users of the system will be guided through the process via an interactive interface and will be able to tailor the problem according to their needs and select an optimal solution based on their preference.
Through research, suitable algorithms will have to be chosen, moreover, the chosen algorithms have to be implemented in the system in an efficient fashion, best utilising the resources available to avoid unnecessary computational time. The system itself will have to be designed to facilitate the decision making process and enable the user to select optimal solutions to the original problem.

This project requires the below third party libraries to be added to the java build path in order to function:

MOEA Framework v2.4: http://sourceforge.net/projects/moeaframework/files/MOEAFramework-2.4/MOEAFramework-2.4.tar.gz/download

Javaluator v3.0.0:
http://sourceforge.net/projects/javaluator/files/latest/download

Google Gson v2.3.1:
